Hi there, I hope this day finds you healthy.

Unfortunately, we were not able to make to your
dining
room this year while vacationing in Algonquin Park - I 
especially wished to see the model of the Highloand Inn
and the train station in the dining room.

I have been reading on the history of Algonquin Park
but
nowhere could I find a description of where the Highland
Inn was originally located on Cache Lake.

If it is no trouble, could you kindly let me know such that
I need not wait until next year when I visit your lodge?

Regards,

Mackenzie Elizabeth
P.S. How were the  flies and bears this year?
